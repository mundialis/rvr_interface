<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.extract.greenroofs</em> extracts vegetated roofs from aerial
photographs, an nDSM, a building vector layer and optionally an FNK
(Flaechennutzungskatalog) and tree vector layer. The module generates
two outputs: The buildings outlines that have vegetated roofs
(<em>output_buildings</em>) with an added attribute column containing
the percentage of vegetated roof area with respect to total roof area.
The second output (<em>output_vegetation</em>) contains only the
vegetation objects.

<p>
The module works best when a tree vector layer is used as input via the
<em>trees</em> parameter. If this is not given,
<em>r.extract.greenroofs</em> tries to eliminate false alarms by
overhanging trees via the nDSM difference to the remaining roof area.

<p>
Internally, a normalized difference green-blue ratio is used to
discriminate vegetated from non-vegetated areas (the NDVI is not
sensitive enough for sparse roof vegetation). A threshold for the
green-blue ratio can be defined by the <em>gb_thresh</em> parameter.
Empirical testing showed good results for a value of around
<em>gb_thresh=145</em> (on a scale from 0 to 255). The threshold can
also be automatically estimated from green areas defined in the FNK.
For this, the <em>fnk</em>, <em>fnk_column</em>, and <em>gb_perc</em>
parameters must be given. The latter defines the percentile of pixels
in vegetated areas to define as gleen-blue ratio threshold. Empirical
testing yielded good results for <em>gb_perc=25</em> (=1st quartile).

<p>
Optionally, the analysis can be run object-based instead of pixel-based
by using the <em>-s</em> flag. This typically improves the result, but
takes up more processing time. If no appropriate <em>gb_thresh</em>
value is known, it is recommended to run the module a few times without
the <em>-s</em> flag and inspect the result to identify a proper
threshold. The final run should then be performed with the <em>-s</em>
flag.

<p>
The <em>min_veg_size</em> and <em>min_veg_proportion</em> parameters
can be used to eliminate vegetated roof areas by size or proportion of
total roof area.
